        <h1>Outreach &amp; Social Services Program </h1>
        <h2>During the past year, over 4,200 services were provided for children and families in need. </h2>
        
        <p>Caridadâ€™s Social Services Department dramatically increased the total services we provided for those in need this past year.  Our programs for families facing financial insecurities include: providing food assistance, clothing, children & baby supplies, youth education and enrichment support, personal care items, and emergency living assistance.  We seek to eliminate the cycle of poverty for the families we serve in South Florida. Below are a few of our highlights from this past year:</p>
